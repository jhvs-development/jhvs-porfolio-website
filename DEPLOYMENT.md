# GoDaddy Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Production Build Ready!

Your portfolio website has been successfully built and is ready for deployment to GoDaddy hosting.

## üìÅ Deployment Files

The production-ready files are located in the `out/` directory:

```
out/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main homepage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 404.html           # Custom 404 page

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _next/             # Next.js optimized assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # Project images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.svg, *.jpeg      # Static assets
```

## üåê GoDaddy Deployment Steps

### Method 1: File Manager (Recommended for GoDaddy)

1. **Login to GoDaddy cPanel**
   - Go to your GoDaddy hosting account
   - Access cPanel/File Manager

2. **Navigate to public_html**
   - Open File Manager
   - Go to `public_html` directory (this is your website root)

3. **Upload Files**
   - **Option A**: Zip the `out` folder contents and upload
     ```bash
     cd out
     zip -r portfolio-website.zip .
     ```
   - **Option B**: Upload files directly via drag & drop

4. **Extract & Configure**
   - If using zip: Extract all files to `public_html` root
   - Ensure `index.html` is in the root of `public_html`
   - Set proper file permissions (755 for folders, 644 for files)

### Method 2: FTP Upload

1. **FTP Credentials**
   - Get FTP details from GoDaddy hosting settings
   - Host: Usually your domain or an IP
   - Username: Your hosting username
   - Password: Your hosting password

2. **Upload via FTP Client**
   ```bash
   # Using FileZilla, WinSCP, or command line
   # Upload entire contents of 'out' folder to public_html
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Domain Setup
- Point your domain to GoDaddy hosting (if not already done)
- Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

### 2. SSL Certificate
- Enable SSL in GoDaddy hosting settings
- Ensure HTTPS redirect is configured

### 3. .htaccess Configuration (Optional)
Create `.htaccess` in public_html for better performance:

```apache
# Enable compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Enable browser caching
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"

</IfModule>
